# Classification-of-toxic-comments
Colab Notebook with solution to Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification competition


Problem Statement: A Kaggle competition for a multi-class classification problem on text data - each text sample can belong to various classes. You must create a model which predicts the probability of each class for each text sample. The details can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

Data: You can use the training data provided in the Kaggle link. You may use a subset of data if you feel the data is too large. You can also split the data into training and validation sets. 

Metrics:  You can choose to use the metric provided in the contest or you can use any other metric which you feel is suitable. 

Challenge:  
Design a classification system using the traditional NLP techniques - for instance - stop word removal, stemming... etc -  followed by a standard ML algorithm like Trees. 
Design a classification system using Neural Networks - CNN, LSTM' s, etc - whichever you feel is relevant. *
